            <h2>Progressive Enhancement Writing Assignment</h2>
            <p>
                Progressive enhancement is from the reading provided, 
                a “content up” way to view the design process for creating web related content, 
                it starts with the raw content, then adds layers upon it. When compared to the 
                “graceful degradation” philosophy, progressive enhancement is a more sustainable 
                way to produce content, relying not on the browser features, but upon underlying 
                content itself, and building upon it with the design, and then topping it off with 
                functionality, all without relying upon the newest browser specs to perform well. 
                This leaves aging machines with old ways of accessing the web more availability to use 
                this content. And frankly, based on how old some of the tech in the USA is, this is for 
                the best. </p>
            <h2>Segway Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
            <p>
                Quite frankly, I had a rough time with this project. I went for a rather basic design, 
                opting for rounded edges and a simple color scheme. I had a hard time with the overall layout
                of the page, and I feel like I could have done better with the overall design. Most of my design 
                choices were made on the fly, but I feel like it ended up coming together in a satisfying way. 
            </p>
            <p>
                For the revisions I made, it was mostly about color corrections and layout changes. 
                I added a couple more pictures as well. I hada few different people review the site, and
                other than a few minor changes, as stated previously, they all seemed to like it.
                Quite frankly, I am not sure what I would do differently, and I think I did a decent job with my
                level of knowledge and experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have enjoyed my time in this class quite a bit, and I have learned a lot about web design 
                and development. I'm not sure if its a field I would consider a career in, but I believe the experience
                I have gained will be useful in my future job prospects. If I had to go back and change one thing, I 
                would definantly have made more practice pages, and overall practiced page layouts much more. 
                It was probably the hardest part of the class for me, and I feel like I could have done much better. 
            </p>
